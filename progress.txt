August 05,2025

A simple web application that help a dugsi do the following:

1. Keep track student attendance
	With this I’m able to see who is present and missing form my class

2. Keep track of student progress. 
	It helps me understand if thye are progress or not
3. Keep track of family payments, revenue and costs
4. Feature where I’m able to communicate with parents and send notifications to them


Good features to have,
A place where they can learn they’re quran and greenbook
Dugsi Learning Center
Where they can learn and watch videos. A platform where they can learn more about there religion
Keep track of progress and time spent at home. SO I know who is doing practice
Good Onboarding process
Families that want to join the dugsi program, can sign documents via online, take payment online. And read and watch dugsi vidoe about rules and regulation.
